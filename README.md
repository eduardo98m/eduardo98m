### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Eduardo, a mechanical engineer with a passion for reinforcement learning ðŸ’¡ and robotics ðŸ¤–.

- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on RoboSim (and RoboVis), an open source physics engine (and visualizer) for robotics simulations. 

- ðŸ’¬ I'm always happy to discuss topics like mobile robots, legged robots, and any other robotics themes. I find that collaboration and sharing ideas leads to new innovations!
